# GlobalShala-Internship

My role as a Data Analyst intern, alongside my teammates, consisting of six other interns, was to :

• Analyze data from GlobalShala’s Marketing team, on ad campaigns in order to generate actionable reports for future campaigns.

• Effectively analyze data using data visualization tools (Excel and PowerBI) to improve the look of presentations and data visualizations based on best practices in design.

• Serve as project lead in a team of six interns to complete weekly tasks and reporting back to the project coordinator.
